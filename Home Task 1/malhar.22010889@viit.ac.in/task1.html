                <h2>IPL 2023 Started from 31st March in Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmadadabad </h2>
                <p>posted 10 hours ago (sports)</p>
                <p class="text">That's a pretty comfortable win for the defending champions, GT. Led by Rashid Khan with the ball, 
                    they restricted CSL to 20 short of a par score, and then chased it down fairly easily. In the end, two 
                    blows from Rashid Khan turned a possibly tight finish to a walk in the park in the last over. The win will 
                    be extra sweet because they couldn't use their Impact Player properly thanks to the injury to Kane Williamson when fielding. 
                    The pace of the match hasn't been great with more than four hours taken</p>

                    South African de Villiers and Gayle of the West Indies had been inducted into the RCB 
                    Hall of Fame last year, for their tremendous contribution to the Indian Premier League franchise. 
                    They received their medals of honour from esteemed guests towards the end of the event on Sunday. An elated de Villiers said: “It is a 
                    touching gesture by RCB to induct me into the Hall of Fame. This franchise has a special place in my heart. I missed the [Chinnaswamy] atmosphere, so it was great to relive the experience once again.” On his part, 
                    Gayle said: “Firstly, thanks to the franchise for inducting me into the Hall of Fame. I have many fun memories of playing at Chinnaswamy. It (return) felt like a 
                    homecoming for me.” Both de Villiers and Gayle served RCB for long and played key roles in two of its IPL runner-up finishes (in 2011 and 2016).</p>
